    <h2>dotfiles</h2>

    <p>This project is simply an attempt to organize, version-control and share my own dotfiles across systems I use as well as with other people.
    Heavy inspiration was taken from <a href="https://github.com/holman/dotfiles">holman&rsquo;s dotfiles</a> on Github, but the main script is written from scratch.</p>

    <p>The idea is that you&rsquo;ll fragment and sort your dotfiles in subdirectories of <code>~/.dotfiles</code>, and then run <code>dotfiles.rb</code> to transfer the contents of these files into your home directory.
    Two modes of operation are implemented; symlinking and merging.
    The default <code>Rules</code> file (explained later) showcases pretty much all the features of the rules DSL.
    Additional rules can be added to the <code>Rules</code> file to customize the operation of <code>dotfiles.rb</code>.</p>

    <p>Since I use this repository to store my own dotfiles as well, I have organized things into subdirectories. The default <code>Rules</code> file runs most of its rules on two of these subdirectories; the <code>common</code> directory and one directory corresponding to the current machine.</p>

    <h2>install</h2>

    <p>Installing is fairly simple, if you only want the script and none of the version-controlling goodies:</p>

    <ol>
    <li><code>git clone https://github.com/urdh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles</code></li>
    </ol>


    <p>After moving your dotfiles to subfolders in <code>~/.dotfiles</code>, renaming them and customizing the Rules file, simply do this:</p>

    <ol>
    <li><code>cd ~/.dotfiles</code></li>
    <li><code>./dotfiles.rb -v</code></li>
    </ol>


    <p>The script will symlink and merge your files as instructed.</p>

    <h3>advanced install</h3>

    <p>If you plan on version-controlling your dotfiles as well (and feel comfortable using Git), I recommend forking the repository on Github, then creating your own branch(es) for whatever machines you&rsquo;ve got dotfiles on (and closing the branches you won&rsquo;t use):</p>

    <ol>
    <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">Fork the repository on Github</a>.</li>
    <li><code>git clone git@github.com:&lt;username&gt;/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles</code></li>
    </ol>


    <p>You can now start moving your dotfiles into <code>~/.dotfiles</code>, splitting them into categories, projects or any other organized mess. Customize the <code>Rules</code> file and commit+push your initial setup.
    I prefer to make one commit for every logical change, since that makes it easy to cherrypick or disable specific files by reverting or transplanting changesets between branches.</p>

    <p>If you choose to fork the project, and make useful changes to the <code>dotfiles.rb</code> script (or add useful dotfiles to the <code>contrib/</code> directory), feel free to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">send a pull request</a>.</p>

    <h2>the rules</h2>

    <p>The script reads instructions from <code>~/.dotfiles/Rules</code> and applies these to process the files in <code>~/.dotfiles</code>.
    Each file matches only one rule, and rules are matched in the order that they appear in the <code>Rules</code> file.</p>

    <p>There are three different instructions available:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>ignore &lt;regex&gt;</code> tells the script to ignore all files and directories matching the regular expression <code>&lt;regex&gt;</code>.</li>
    <li><code>symlink &lt;regex&gt;, &lt;target&gt;</code> tells the script to create a symlink from <code>~/&lt;target&gt;</code> to the file matching <code>&lt;regex&gt;</code>. The target filename may contain tokens of the type <code>$[1-9]</code> which will be replaced by the corresponding matching group in the regular expression.</li>
    <li><code>merge &lt;regex&gt;, &lt;target&gt;, [&lt;group&gt;]</code> tells the script to merge all files matching <code>&lt;regex&gt;</code> directly into the file <code>&lt;target&gt;</code>. The files will be appended to <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> in lexiographical order. As with <code>symlink</code>, <code>&lt;target&gt;</code> may contain tokens of the type <code>$[1-9]</code> which will be replaced by the corresponding matching group in the regular expression. It will also collect files by the first matching group (unless <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> is specified).</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Additionally, you can use regular ruby code, the <code>@machine</code> variable containing the machine hostname, and the following blocks:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>directory &lt;dir&gt; do ...</code> performs the actions in the block, but only matches files in the specified directory.</li>
    <li><code>directories &lt;dirs&gt; do ...</code> does the same thing, but for multiple directories.</li>
    </ul>
